## Complete Conversation Summary
The user requested to fix a "place order error" in the leather shop e-commerce application, push changes to GitHub, and run a comprehensive system check. 

**Initial Investigation**: I began by exploring the codebase structure and identified it as a Next.js e-commerce application with Supabase backend and Playwright as the designated test framework. I located the place order functionality in the checkout page and examined the database schema files.

**Root Cause Identification**: The core issue was a database schema mismatch in the order placement process. The checkout code was attempting to insert order items with a `price` field, but the actual database table (`order_items`) expected different field names: `product_price`, `product_name`, and `subtotal` according to the SQL schema definition in `scripts/006_create_orders.sql`.

**Solution Implemented**: I fixed the schema mismatch by modifying the order items creation in `app/checkout/page.tsx`. The fix changed the order items mapping to include the correct field names:
- Changed `price` to `product_price`
- Added `product_name` field with fallback to "Unknown Product"  
- Added `subtotal` field calculated as `product_price * quantity`

**Testing Attempts**: I started the development server successfully and attempted to test the fix through browser automation. However, testing was limited by the authentication requirement - users must be signed in to add items to cart. I attempted to create a test user but encountered Supabase's email confirmation requirement, which prevented immediate testing of the order flow.

**Current Status**: The primary bug fix is complete and ready for deployment. The code changes address the database schema mismatch that was causing the place order error. However, the changes have not yet been committed to Git or pushed to GitHub. The system check and comprehensive testing remain incomplete due to authentication barriers in the testing environment.

**Next Steps Needed**: The solution requires git commit and push to GitHub, plus implementation of proper E2E tests using Playwright (which is the designated test framework) to verify the complete order flow works correctly after the authentication hurdles are resolved.
