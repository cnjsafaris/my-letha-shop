## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on diagnosing and fixing critical errors in the admin dashboard's "Add Product" functionality. The user requested that I continue investigating an admin dashboard error they were experiencing when trying to add products, building on previous work that had already addressed several production issues.

**Initial Problem Context:**
The conversation began with me having already identified and fixed several critical production errors including `is_luxury` property access issues in ProductCard components, removed non-existent database fields, added missing favicon.ico, and implemented proper null checks with optional chaining.

**Core Issue Investigation:**
I systematically tested the admin dashboard's add product functionality by:
- Successfully accessing the admin dashboard at localhost:3002/admin
- Opening the Add Product dialog which displayed correctly with all form fields
- Filling out a test product form (Test Leather Wallet, $75.99, Luxury Wallets category, etc.)
- Encountering a database constraint error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint 'products_sku_key'"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The primary issue was that empty SKU fields in the product form were being submitted as empty strings rather than NULL values to the database. Since the products table has a UNIQUE constraint on the SKU field, multiple products with empty string SKUs created constraint violations.

**Technical Solution Implemented:**
I modified the AddProductDialog component to properly sanitize and handle form data:
- Implemented `.trim()` operations on all text fields to remove whitespace
- Used null coalescing (`|| null`) to convert empty strings to NULL values
- Properly structured the productData object to handle optional fields correctly
- Added explicit handling for sku, material, color, and other optional fields

**Verification and Success:**
After implementing the fix, I re-tested the add product functionality and achieved:
- Successful product creation with "Product added successfully" notification
- Automatic dialog closure after successful submission
- No database constraint errors
- Proper handling of empty optional fields

**Additional Improvements Made:**
- Created shared type definitions in `lib/types.ts` to prevent interface duplication
- Updated ProductCard and FeaturedProducts components to use shared types
- Added proper optional chaining throughout the codebase for safer property access
- Enhanced data validation and sanitization in the admin interface

**Current Status:**
The admin dashboard's add product functionality is now fully working. Products can be successfully added with all required and optional fields properly handled. The fix addresses both the immediate SKU constraint issue and implements broader improvements to form data handling and type safety.

**Future Implications:**
This fix establishes a pattern for proper form data sanitization that should be applied to other admin forms (edit product, categories, etc.). The shared type definitions and null handling approach provides a foundation for consistent data management across the application.
