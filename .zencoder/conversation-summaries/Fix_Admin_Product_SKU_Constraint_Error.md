## Complete Conversation Summary
The user encountered a critical error when trying to add products through the admin dashboard, receiving a 409 status error with the message "duplicate key value violates unique constraint 'products_sku_key'". This error prevented administrators from adding new products to the inventory system.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Through database investigation, I discovered that the issue stemmed from improper handling of empty SKU fields. The database had a UNIQUE constraint on the SKU column, but when users left the SKU field empty in the admin form, the application was inserting empty strings ("") instead of NULL values. Since multiple products with empty string SKUs would violate the unique constraint, product creation failed.

**Technical Investigation**: I created diagnostic scripts to query the database and found one existing product ("phone case") with an empty string SKU, confirming the constraint conflict. The database showed a mix of products with valid SKUs, NULL SKUs, and problematic empty string SKUs.

**Solution Implementation**: 
1. **Code Fix**: Modified `components/admin/add-product-dialog.tsx` to properly sanitize form data by trimming whitespace from all text fields and converting empty strings to NULL values for optional fields like SKU, description, material, and color.
2. **Data Cleanup**: Used the Supabase service role key to update existing products with empty string SKUs to NULL values, resolving the constraint conflict.
3. **Form Validation Enhancement**: Improved the overall form data processing to handle edge cases and ensure consistent data types.

**Testing and Verification**: Used browser automation with Playwright to thoroughly test the fix by:
- Logging into the admin dashboard
- Opening the Add Product dialog
- Successfully adding multiple test products with empty SKU fields
- Verifying success notifications and proper form behavior
- Confirming no constraint errors occurred

**Outcome**: The SKU constraint error was completely resolved. Administrators can now successfully add products with or without SKU values. The solution ensures data consistency by properly handling optional fields and maintains database integrity through appropriate use of NULL values instead of empty strings.

**Key Technical Insights**: This issue highlights the importance of proper optional field handling in database applications. Empty strings and NULL values are treated differently by database constraints, and forms should consistently convert empty optional fields to NULL to avoid unique constraint violations. The fix also demonstrates the need for comprehensive form data sanitization to prevent similar issues with other optional text fields.
