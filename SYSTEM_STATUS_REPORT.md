# 🏪 Leather Shop System Status Report

**Generated:** December 27, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

## 📋 Issue Resolution Summary

### Problem Fixed: Place Order Database Error
- **Issue:** Order placement failed due to database schema mismatch
- **Root Cause:** `order_items` table field mapping incorrect (using `price` instead of `product_price`)
- **Solution:** Updated checkout code to use correct field structure:
  - `price` → `product_price`
  - Added missing `product_name` field
  - Added `subtotal` calculation

### Changes Implemented
- ✅ Fixed `app/checkout/page.tsx` order items field mapping
- ✅ Removed incompatible `payment_status` field from order creation
- ✅ Added manual order number generation: `LS{timestamp}`
- ✅ Created comprehensive testing and verification scripts
